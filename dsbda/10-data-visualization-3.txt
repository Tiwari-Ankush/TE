Data Visualization III
Download the Iris flower dataset or any other dataset into a DataFrame (e.g., [URL] ). Scan the dataset and give the inference as:
1. List down the features and their types (e.g., numeric, nominal) available in the dataset.
2. Create a histogram for each feature in the dataset to illustrate the feature distributions.
3. Create a box plot for each feature in the dataset.
4. Compare distributions and identify outliers.
