2. Locate an open source data from the web (e.g. [1](https://bing.com/search?q=)). Provide a clear description of the data and its source (i.e., URL of the web site).
3. Load the Dataset into pandas dataframe.
4. Data Preprocessing: check for missing values in the data using pandas Insult(), describe() function to get some initial statistics. Provide valuable descriptions types of variables etc.
5. Data Formatting and Data Normalization: Summarize types of variables by checking each checkmark dimension of the data frame.

In turn categorical variables, explain every operation that you do in above steps and explain everything that you do to import/read/scrape the data set.
