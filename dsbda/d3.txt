1. Perform the following statistics (mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation) for the provided summary statistics on any open source dataset (e.g., data.csv)
   - Categorize (age, income etc.) with numeric variables grouped by one of the qualitative data variable available. For example, if your categorical variable is age groups and quantitative variables is income, then provide summary statistics of income grouped by the age group. Create a list that contains a numeric value for each response to the quantitative variable.
   - Provide the codes with outputs and explain everything that you do in this step.

2. Write a Python program to display some basic statistical details like percentile, mean standard deviation etc. of the species of 'Iris-setosa', 'Iris-versicolor' and 'Iris-vercicolor' of iris.csv dataset.

Provide the statistics with outputs and explain everything that you do in this step.
