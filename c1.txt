    - In the context of EC2 instances, users can choose from a variety of operating systems, including Linux and Windows.

12. **AMI:**
    - An AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is a template used to create EC2 instances in AWS.
    - It contains the operating system, application server, and applications needed to launch an EC2 instance.

13. **Instance Type (t2.micro):**
    - Instance types in AWS define the virtual hardware specifications of an EC2 instance, such as CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.
    - For example, t2.micro is a type of EC2 instance with a small amount of CPU and memory resources, suitable for low-traffic applications or testing environments.

14. **Key Pair for Instance:**
    - A key pair consists of a public key and a private key used for secure communication between a client and an EC2 instance.
    - It is used to authenticate and securely connect to an EC2 instance using protocols like SSH.

15. **SSH:**
    - SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure communication between a client and a server.
    - It is commonly used to remotely access and manage EC2 instances in AWS.

16. **HTTPS:**
    - HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a protocol used for secure communication over a computer network.
    - It encrypts data transmitted between a client and a server, providing confidentiality and integrity.

17. **Key Pair Type (RSA):**
    - RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a public-key cryptosystem used for secure communication and digital signatures.
    - It is commonly used in key pairs for authentication and encryption in cloud computing environments.

18. **Private Key File Format (.pem):**
    - PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail) is a file format used to store cryptographic keys, including private keys.
    - It is commonly used for SSH key pairs in AWS.

19. **.ppk:**
    - .ppk is a file extension used for private key files generated by PuTTY, a popular SSH client for Windows.
    - It is used for securely connecting to EC2 instances in AWS.

20. **What is PuTTY:**
    - PuTTY is a free and open-source SSH client for Windows.
    - It is used to securely connect to and manage remote servers, including EC2 instances in AWS.

21. **What is OpenSSH:**
    - OpenSSH is a suite of secure networking utilities based on the SSH protocol.
    - It provides tools for secure remote access, file transfer, and tunneling, commonly used in Unix-like operating systems.

22. **IPv4 and IPv6:**
    - IPv4 and IPv6 are versions of the Internet Protocol used to identify devices on a network.
    - IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, while IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, allowing for a larger number of unique addresses.

23. **Host Address:**
    - A host address is a unique identifier assigned to a device on a network, such as an IP address.
